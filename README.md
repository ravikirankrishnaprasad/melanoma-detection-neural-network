# Skin Cancer Detection using Custom CNN

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to build a **multi-class classification model** using a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** in TensorFlow to accurately detect **melanoma**, a highly dangerous form of skin cancer. Melanoma is responsible for approximately 75% of skin cancer-related deaths, and early detection is crucial to improving patient outcomes.

This AI-driven solution aims to assist dermatologists by automating the classification of skin lesion images, reducing manual diagnostic effort and enabling faster medical intervention.

The dataset used in this project contains **2,357 dermoscopic images** of both malignant and benign skin conditions, curated by the **International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)**. These images are categorized across several classes, with a slightly higher representation of melanomas and moles.

## General Information

- This project focuses on the detection of skin cancer using image data.
- The background of the project involves the use of machine learning and image processing techniques to identify melanoma from skin images.
- The business problem addressed by this project is to provide a reliable automated method to assist dermatologists in diagnosing skin cancer, which can significantly reduce manual effort and improve early detection rates.
- The dataset used is from the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) archive, consisting of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases.
- The diseases covered in the dataset include Actinic keratosis, Basal cell carcinoma, Dermatofibroma, Melanoma, Nevus, Pigmented benign keratosis, Seborrheic keratosis, Squamous cell carcinoma, and Vascular lesion.

## Conclusions
- The custom CNN model achieved a high accuracy in detecting melanoma.
- Data augmentation significantly improved the model's performance and helped in handling class imbalances.
- Using a custom model instead of a pre-trained model provided insights into the model architecture and its performance.
- The project demonstrates the potential of AI in medical diagnosis and the importance of handling class imbalances in medical datasets.
