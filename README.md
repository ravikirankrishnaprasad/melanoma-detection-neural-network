## General Information

- This project focuses on the detection of skin cancer using image data.
- The background of the project involves the use of machine learning and image processing techniques to identify melanoma from skin images.
- The business problem addressed by this project is to provide a reliable automated method to assist dermatologists in diagnosing skin cancer, which can significantly reduce manual effort and improve early detection rates.
- The dataset used is from the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) archive, consisting of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases.
- The diseases covered in the dataset include Actinic keratosis, Basal cell carcinoma, Dermatofibroma, Melanoma, Nevus, Pigmented benign keratosis, Seborrheic keratosis, Squamous cell carcinoma, and Vascular lesion.

## Conclusions
- The custom CNN model achieved a high accuracy in detecting melanoma.
- Data augmentation significantly improved the model's performance and helped in handling class imbalances.
- Using a custom model instead of a pre-trained model provided insights into the model architecture and its performance.
- The project demonstrates the potential of AI in medical diagnosis and the importance of handling class imbalances in medical datasets.

## Technologies Used
- Python - 3.7
- TensorFlow - 2.4
