## General Information

- This project focuses on the detection of skin cancer using image data.
- The background of the project involves the use of machine learning and image processing techniques to identify melanoma from skin images.
- The business problem addressed by this project is to provide a reliable automated method to assist dermatologists in diagnosing skin cancer.
- The dataset used is from the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) archive.

## Conclusions
- The model achieved a high accuracy in detecting melanoma.
- Data augmentation significantly improved the model's performance.
- Using a pre-trained model like ResNet-50 yielded better results than training from scratch.
- The project demonstrates the potential of AI in medical diagnosis.

## Technologies Used
- Python - 3.7
- TensorFlow - 2.4
- Keras - 2.4
- Augmentor - 0.2.8
- Pandas - 1.1.5
- NumPy - 1.19.5
